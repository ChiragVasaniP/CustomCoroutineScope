CustomCoroutineScope
CustomCoroutineScope is a utility class designed to provide a customizable coroutine scope for Android applications. It manages coroutine execution and thread handling, ensuring proper management of resources and safe operation across different threads, especially in UI-driven environments.

Features
Custom Thread Management: Creates and manages a custom thread for coroutine execution.
Automatic Thread Switching: Automatically switches between threads based on predefined conditions (e.g., memory thresholds).
Error Handling: Provides a customizable exception handler (CoroutineExceptionHandler) to manage errors within coroutines.
Main Thread Safety: Ensures UI updates and operations are executed safely on the main thread using Dispatchers.Main.
Cancellation: Allows for canceling all coroutines within the scope and interrupts the custom thread if necessary.
Usage
Initialization
kotlin
Copy code
// Create an instance of CustomCoroutineScope
val customScope = CustomCoroutineScope()
Launching Coroutines
Custom Launch

customScope.launchCustom(
    block = {
        // Coroutine block
        println("Running coroutine in custom scope")
        delay(1000)
        println("Coroutine completed")
    },
    onError = { throwable ->
        // Error handler
        println("Coroutine error: $throwable")
    },
    onComplete = {
        // Completion callback
        println("Coroutine execution finished")
    }
)
Automatic Thread Management


customScope.launchAutoManage(
    block = {
        // Coroutine block with automatic thread management
        println("Running coroutine with automatic thread management")
        delay(1000)
        // Simulate updating UI (replace with actual UI update code in Android)
        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            println("Coroutine completed")
        }
    },
    onError = { throwable ->
        // Error handler
        println("Coroutine error: $throwable")
    },
    onComplete = {
        // Completion callback
        println("Coroutine execution finished")
    }
)
Cancellation


// Cancel the scope and all coroutines
customScope.cancel()
Additional Considerations
Android Context: Ensure launchAutoManage is called within an Android component (e.g., Activity, Fragment) where Dispatchers.Main is available for UI updates.
Thread Safety: Always perform UI updates on the main thread (Dispatchers.Main) to comply with Android's UI thread requirements.
Customization: Customize CustomCoroutineScope further based on specific application requirements and performance considerations.
